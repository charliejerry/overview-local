Sweet, sweet obsessions. They make you play PS3 for six hours straight and then go to bed, dreaming of hidden blades and assassins... and they make you seek out every little thing you can find of the thing you're obsessed with. Thus, I came across Oliver Bowden's books based on the incredibly awesome Assassin's Creed games. Though I can say I'm not very thrilled, I'm certainly not disappointed, either.

Bowden has breathed new life into the characters of the game, and the game is what provides an otherwise dull book with a breathtaking atmosphere. Trying to read the book without having played through the game is somewhat like reading a walkthrough of the game - you need the game's beautiful visuals and sexy Italian accents to truly enjoy the book. I tried reading ahead of the game at one point and this only confirmed what I've just stated: Game first, then book. Trust me.

The writing in itself is unimpressive and even repetitive - the language tends to get quite... bold, even bordering on vulgar and in some cases (Bartolomeo) it adds to the character, while in other cases (Caterina), it just seems childish. Because there's A LOT of story in the game and Bowden's tried to fit it all in there (which is impressive, by the by), it scrambles by very fast, and it can seem a bit boring because it's basically the same going on all the way (but what do you expect? The game is about hacking and slashing away at foes most of the time - of course the book would be about the same thing).

In the end, it's really fun to get another perspective on Ezio's story. Bowden's taken out and put in pieces which flesh out some things from the game. He's added his own thing while keeping a lot of original game dialogue. Just try and play through the games first (or watch someone play through them), 'cause without the wonderful setting of the game, the book is quite a bland experience.

Oh yes, after reading that description you surely are drooling over this book. Well hold yer spit 'n lend me yer eyes 'cause thar are a some problems here (God, I love pirate talk!). One - a simple question. Did you play the game? If you didn’t know: yes this is a game, but not just any game. This game is a masterpiece, probably my favorite so far. Ok, so if you didn’t know this then shame on you. If you didn’t play the game then I say drop the idea of buying and reading this book. If you want to buy it just to have something pretty to look at then go ahead. The cover is amazing, as all the artwork for this game is. Two. If you are a gamer and you played it… well, no difference there, is it? The book follows the game pattern maybe too closely for my taste. It was great that at some points I was comparing the way the assassinations were done in the book to the strategies I used in the game. This went on for what? A quarter or half of the book but eventually I got bored. I thought I’d love it because, let’s face it, so many great characters appear in the story. We have Ezio, Leonardo, Machiavelli, La Volpe, Mario and many more. Eventually even these characters couldn’t keep me from falling asleep while reading it. Some details were cool, stuff that I didn’t notice in the game but I still find the story chaotic. I feel that the events don’t stick together too well. Towards the end of the story we have a scene (no spoilers, don’t worry) where *blank* looks at *someone*. Those who played the game know it’s Desmond. So we have a hint that he should have been in the book too. But I don’t know where because I couldn’t trace him. I think it would have been cooler if the author integrated the Animus in the story somehow. Maybe it would have given the book a bit of spice. I am really disappointed because I was expecting something more of this. I feel bad that I won’t be giving it such a high score…

I’m really into Assassins Creed at the moment. Having ignored the first game I got the second one as gift for my birthday and I was engrossed with it so when I saw this book I grabbed a copy.

The story follows the events of Assassins Creed 2 so I waited until I’d worked through the game before reading it.

A big part of the game is that there are lots of side missions and other things to do as well as following the main plotline so it was good to revisit the story and it’s easy to loose track a bit while playing.

What was a little interesting is that I’ve progressed onto the next game, Assassins Creed Brotherhood and there are some sections in the book that are actually flashbacks in the next game. In a strange bit of coincidence I started the flashback sequences in the game at the same time as I was reading that part in the book so I knew what I was supposed to be doing in the mission straightaway!

While I enjoyed reading the book it’s no literary masterpiece so probably only worth reading if you’re a fan of the game.

There is a book to go with the Brotherhood game too so as with this I’ll wait till I’ve worked through the game. The Brotherhood game is vast and I’m struggling to keep trac.

This novel based on a video game is as ordinary as you would expect. Even Angelina Jolie couldn't save this turkey.

A young man in Renaissance Florence has his parents executed by a rival gang.

There's a lot of padding and the behaviour and mores of the characters are pure 21st century and have no relation to the period whatsoever. 
-=
My husband bought this and commented "this is like a video game". Well... duh. I've never played the game, but the ads are awesome so I read it. It's actually got potential, but literally reads like a video game where the main character has tasks to complete with obstacles along the way... I couldn't get past that.
-=
I am not a game player (have only watched the game being played) but an avid reader and I must say that I actually really enjoyed this book, quite humourous and very entertaining. I didn't have the knowledge of the game to compare it too, so it was a good read for me and I don't feel that there is anything lost in it.

I was very grateful for the translations at the back of the book and the 'family tree' it added to the enjoyment of the book, as i did tend to get lost in the many characters and the Latin/Italian words that were thrown in throughout the book.

Many characters in there were just great especially Seniora Sforza very amusing woman.

It was also quit an emotional roller coaster, going through the highs and lows that follow Ezio.

I will be reading the others.

This book was a really cool book which interest me a lot. This book caught my eye and i read the whole thing mostly because it was a popular game turned into a book and i also wanted to read that action felt in the games.The book was confusing at first the first time i read it because of the setting switches and characters switches but after reading it the 2nd time i got that the storyline. I felt bad for the main character because he went throught a lot and lost a lot of people close to him. Also because the way he was forced to live after his family was betrayed and killed. This book was very controversial because he was an assassin which people are suppose to fear and hate but somehow in the book he is welcomed as a hero working in the darkness while his enemies fear him the most because of his grugde he holds. Made me wonder why the people thought of him as a hero and i found out later on, that like he was sort of a liberator who liberated the people from like evil greedy hands.

In these days of computer gaming, more and more books are being based on the computer games we can buy. I even saw an animated cartoon of Pacman the other day, in full HD on a 3DTV. Some of these books are quite good (See Force Unleashed II), and some of them are poor. Unfortunately, This is one of the latter.

I don't normally explain the plot in my reviews, but in this case it's a major point I need to make. For those of you who aren't really into computer games - or just haven't heard of this particular one - Assassin's Creed II is part of a franchise where you play a character called Desmond. As Desmond, you enter a machine that allows you to relive your ancestors memories - in the hope that you will learn something that will help you in the battle between Assassins and Templars in the modern day. So far in the franchise there have been two Ancestors introduced, and the one this game, and Book, focuses on is an Assassin called Ezio. It's a really good game - and a very popular one.

Then there's the book. It decides to completely ignore the story about Desmond, the modern day character. Instead it focuses solely on Ezio's Story. Which is fair enough, Ezio's story still existed long before Desmond was born. However, at the very climax of the game, there is an event which only makes sense if you know about the modern day. In fact, it makes little sense then, but in the book - it makes no sense whatsoever. So the reward for reading through the book? Confusion. No good climax. Just a letdown. Unless you know what it means from the game, but then you know the story anyway.

And then there's the work in actually reading the book itself. It's not an easy task. It starts off well, the first page was good enough to make me buy the book. Then the writing gets quite simple, except when switches, apparently randomly, into Italian for just a few words. and not words that I'm likely to know. Some people may recognise "Case, Dulce Case" as "Home, Sweet Home", but what's a grullo? and why does it occur in a book written in English? There is a glossary, at the back, but I did see a couple of terms that weren't in there, and even still, looking them up breaks the flow of the story. It's as if the book has been translated from Italian, but by a translator who couldn't be bothered to do the whole thing. And it's really annoying.

And finally there is the characters. Now I had knowledge of the game's characters before I read this, so this might be in comparison rather than in general, but I didn't find anyone to be really developed well. Ezio a little, but other characters not at all. This is especially true of Rodrigo Borgia, the Spaniard who became Pope Alexander VI. He just seems one-dimensional. Even as Ezio is walking away from his corpse. Which is a shame, as he is characterised so well in both the game, and the TV show "The Borgias", although as very different people.

In conclusion, I can only say negative things about this book. Being a lover of the games, I had thought it would be good. But it's not. I'll never re-read this book, and I can't recommend it to anyone. Maybe the other two books already published are better (this was the first to be published), but I would suggest you give this one a miss. Unless you understand Italian, and like a challenge.
-=
Was about as good as I expected it to be. The main problems I had with it was how quickly Ezio learned how to be such a good assassin, but I guess the unrealisticness of it come with the fact that it is a book based on a video game.
-=
I was pleasantly surprised upon reading 'Assassin's Creed'. For a book to encompass every aspect of the game would be impossible - there are optional missions such as the Assassins' tombs and the glyphs that were more a part of Desmond Miles' story than Ezio's - so it obviously just tells the main story.

Oliver Bowden makes everything authentic, from the history surrounding both real Italy and the fictional parts (thieves, courtesans and mercenary factions for instance), to use of Italian throughout dialogue. He also developed the character of Ezio, the chief example being his first love Cristina, who he tries to meet up with in the book, and who is constantly on his mind, but who doesn't have a mention after her initial name-drop in the game.

I think that, on the whole, even though I will eventually know the story of 'Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood', I would be intrigued to read the book, as there are only some experiences that can be gleaned from having someone else's take on a story that you also know. 
-=
I can imagine this book being read by a teen who knows about the game but who can not play the game for some reason - for example, intelligent parents. While access to the video games rated M for "mature" (content may be suitable for those over 17 years of age) may be limited and rightfully so, the access to books is free, so this little thing will be a good substitute until the reader is old enough to not only read other books but also play the actual game.
It being a book based on a video game, I did not start it with high expectations: yes, predictable dialogues, with pathos worthy of children's comic books about superheroes; yes, predictable plot, enough to keep the simple mind following it; yes, the flimsy sexual innuendoes (presumably) agitating the young virgin mind; yes, the expected nod to historical facts so as to appear less hollow than the book really is. Personally, I was especially amused with the hypocritical attitude the protagonist demonstrated on killing of persons. The absolute last chapter, while not being any better than the book in any way, was the only one that I actually enjoyed and found worthy of the time I spent reading it.
Well, good try overall to invite minors' interest in the franchise, to reel them in while they're young. However, for anyone who's read more than 10 books it will not be extraordinary, and for anyone who's read more than a 100 books, it might not even register on the radar beyond a checkmark on our lists.
-=
This was a really interesting book, based on the game.
It was seet it Itlay, Renaissance and centers around Ezio,
the young son of a merchant. When his family are murdered and
he seeks revenge, the assasins creed are there for him to learn
the ways of the assasin.

It was a hard book to read and i suggest only reading it if you have
time and patience:)

Good read though!
-=
I played the game first before I found out this book.

Overall, I think this is a great book. But I would recommend to those who haven't play the game to read the book first, since there are parts not included in the book (Desmund and the gang).

I enjoy reading the last pages, which had some Italian words and phrases. lol.
-=
I found this a tiresome read. The way it was written really irritated me. The character, Ezio, irritated me. But the setting-I liked.

First I will acknowledge that this is a book based on a game. It is wasn't I would compare this to the likes of Robin Hobb and Brent Weeks with little of a positive nature.

You don't need to have played the game, just various games, to understand that the style is very game-like. I think generally, that it does follow too much with a game like style. It certainly leaves little space for character development. I would have liked this more if Ezio wasn't such an A-class assassin that Bowden made him. I would have liked to see his failures more, his trials, everything that he would have done to collect those pieces of the Codex. This could have even been three books instead of one.

If you like books written this way, then go ahead. I for one did not like it much at all. It was so close to being a Did-not-finish. If I wanted a story written this way I would have just played the game. That way I would have both the action and feel of being an assassin. (14)
-=
3 stars, not because of the story but beacuse of the writing...I love the games and thought that i should read the books to have more information abou the characters, the missions etc.

I've started the book in late December and since then i've been forcing myself to finish it. It was like a rock in my shoe, i didn't want to read it because some of the events were so boring and they lacked so much of vocabulary and action.
I was expecting more, much more from a book that was inspired by a brilliant game.
-=
If you've played Assassin's Creed II, then you've practically read the book. There's a few things in the book, like some of Ezio's memories, that weren't in the game, but it pretty much describes in detail everything that happened in the game. If you haven't played it, then the book is pretty good if you like historical fiction and your main characters assassinating people.

I’m a huge fan of the Assassin’s Creed series. I’ve played all of the games (1,2,Brotherhood,Revelations), and have really enjoyed playing them, so – naturally, I thought I’d give the novels a try. Now, I know video-game adaptations aren’t normally top quality literature, and Renaissance certainly isn’t. In fact, I read not only Renaissance sometime last year, but also Brotherhood and The Secret Crusade, all Assassin’s Creed tie-in novels and all written by Oliver Bowden. And, seeing as I’m starting to re-play the video games, I thought that I’d give the books another try as well. But I figured that I’d skip The Secret Crusade and move onto Renaissance, which is technically the second book in the series even though it was the first Assassin’s Creed novel released. So, my verdict?

Well, you’ll have to find that out for yourself, after I’ve informed you of the blurb, which is below:

"‘I will seek Vengeance upon those who betrayed my family. I am Ezio Auditore da Firenze. I am an Assassin…’

Betrayed by the ruling families of Italy, a young man embarks upon an epic quest for vengeance. To eradicate corruption and restore his family’s honour, he will learn the art of the assassins.

Along the way, Ezio will call upon the wisdom of such great minds as Leonardo Da Vinci and Niccolo Machiavelli – knowing that survival is bound to the skills by which he must live.

To his allies, he will become a force for change – fighting for freedom and justice. To his enemies, he will become a threat dedicated to the destruction of the tyrants abusing the people of Italy.

So begins an epic story of power, revenge and conspiracy.

TRUTH WILL BE WRITTEN IN BLOOD"

Assassin’s Creed 2 has probably the most epic video game story line eve, so the first thing that we’ve got to look at really, is how well does Bowden translate the video game into a five-hundred page novel? Yes, you heard me, Renaissance stands at just over five hundred pages long, a large word count for not just a tie-in novel, but also a non tie-in novel as well. So it’s huge. Is it worth it, though? can Renaissance emerge triumphant where countless of other video-game novels have failed? Its premise is good, the video game it’s based around is epic, its main character is about as awesome as they come, but… no. Sadly, Renaissance doesn’t lift my expectation of video-game tie-ins. Although it may not be terrible, as I certainly had fun whilst reading the book, Bowden’s novel isn’t particularly brilliant, neither.

Sure, the plot’s nice, fast-paced and well drawn together. Ezio is a likeable character, and there are even some bonus bits that we don’t get to see in the novel brought into the game. The novel draws upon many aspects of Renaissance-era Italy, just like the video game itself. I’m not going to give Bowden credit here for the plot as it’s been already created by the team at Ubisoft (the ones behind the Assassin’s Creed video game franchise), but it’s worth pointing out that the historical characters such as Leonardo Da Vinci and Niccolo Machiavelli, as well as indeed – the Renaissance-era itself, is tied neatly into the fictional elements and I didn’t catch any errors in the historical side of things, although there might have been a few that I’ve missed.

Renaissance itself is unlikely to draw in newcomers to the Assassin’s Creed franchise though. In fact, I’d say that it might put them off getting the game altogether. The writing doesn’t match up to quality that George RR Martin fans will be familiar with, and neither does it match up to stuff like the enjoyable The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher or Brent Week’s awesome Night Angel Trilogy. But then, Bowden isn’t trying to create a novel that will be the next fantasy epic. The game’s there for that – what Bowden is trying to do is to flush out the storyline a bit more, and provide a break from reading the series for the gamers. A whole host of back-story is created for Ezio, such as his love for Cristina, which we only touched upon in the video game (And explored more about in Brotherhood flashbacks), and this provides a whole new level of depth for Ezio as a character.

The biggest surprise that I got when I read Renaissance was that Desmond’s storyline as a character (gamers will know who I’m referring to here), has been shelved completely. The bits where Desmond is referenced in Ezio’s timeline is also re-cut, making this just a story about Ezio’s adventures and Ezio’s adventures alone. Which I enjoyed once I got used to the fact that Desmond wouldn’t be appearing in any of these novels, after all – I find the parts where he appears the most boring things in the game.

The is an extremely fast paced novel, and it covers a large amount of Ezio’s life, stretching from him as an eighteen-year old to being forty-four by the end of the book. The time-jumps are confusing though, and you have to pay attention to detail or you’ll be wondering why Ezio’s hopped from one part of Italy to another suddenly.

There’s a problem that I had with Renaissance though, and that is character development. Sure, it starts off looking as though Ezio will develop as a character, but once we get out of his early life, it’s fast revealed that Ezio doesn’t develop at all. Sure, he may be slightly more mature at the end of the novel, slightly more skilled in battle, but apart from that… nothing. It ends there. And don’t expect any other characters to be developed, either.

So, all said and done, I believe that it’s fairly safe to say that whilst Renaissance isn’t going to win any awards any time soon, it certainly is an enjoyable, ‘comfort’ read that will give fans of the series a nice break from the standard fantasy fare. Even though the game outclasses the novel in every possible way, the novel is still worth a try, just don’t go in with high expectations.

I would not normally read a novel based on a video game, because if the video game is worth playing, it should have a good story within it anyway.

Also, this novel is based on Assassin's Creed II, and I have only played most of the first one, and a few parts of Brotherhood. Something I abhor is reading a book in a series out of numerical order.

So with all that said, I enjoyed this for what it was. It certainly could have been worse. The writing was serviceable, and there was plenty of action. As a player of the games, the aspects placed in there from the games were not very subtle at all, i.e., leaps of faith and new Codex weapons.

And is it just me, or is anyone else getting a bit sick of the "The Fate of this World rests on the shoulders of this one person!" plots? I am.

Still, an enjoyable and quick read

I came across this book at Heathrow Airport when I was flying back to the United States. I was already familiar with the game but since the first did not have subtitles - at least not on xbox -, I decided to buy it and read it. It is not a classic work, to say the least, but it is an enjoyable retelling of the game. The plot was not surprising at all but it gave some additional insight and it roused my interest in the actual historical facts behind the fiction. Most of them are quite correct, which of course, is more thanks to the authors of the game than to this book. I read it to supplement the game and I got what I wanted. In its entirety it is not a work of art, by all means, but it is an enjoyable novel to read.
-=
Not sure why i stayed with this one to the end. Probably because i did not finish the video game.

If you played the video game you have read the book as it is basically a guided tour of the game.

Not sure what i was expecting here but what i got was the usual good vs evil with this incarnation of good winning.

A bit of a weak ending in my opinion as we are presented with what appeared to me to be space/time travellers explaining how the world got to this point and leaving 15th century Italy's version of mankind to carry on and make it better.

It did present the greats of Italian and world history as everyday joes so to speak and how they bare the mantal of doing the right thing. Divinci was my favourite.

Apparently there are two other books in the series, not so sure i will get to them any time soon. (20)
-=
The story has high octane content which can be realised if you have had the chance to play the game. The action sequences are lucidly described but the overall plot did not stir anything in me. There are several mini-plots and the switch from one to the next occurs too swiftly. I, sometimes, felt that the plot was being dragged too far. Overall, an amateurish effort but good enough for a one-time read. I want to give it 2.5/5 but Goodreads doesn't allow me to do that. :) 
-=
Considering that i own and have rarely played any of the Assassin's Creed books, i knew very little about the story line, the characters, or anything like that. Once i started to read this book & once i started to get into it and be intrigued by what was going on thoroughly became entrenched if you will into this book. I don't necessarily think that you have to be a fan or even a gamer who plays this game in order to read it. It does in my opinion have a good story line between this clan of Assassins and the Knight Templar. Unfortunately the Templar Knights are painted as the villains in this book, but while you progress through this book, you begin to understand why these guys are the sworn enemy of the Assassin's clan. If you are not familiar with this particular series of games then i would most definitely recommend reading this book to maybe give you a little bit of inside knowledge as to how the game might work or maybe even play out. Overall i would definitely give this book a 2 thumbs up and i hope that by reading this review that you pick this book up and eventually read it, and enjoy it as much as i did.
-=
Take this book for what it is - an adaptation of a video game. It won't rock your world, win a Nobel prize, or (most likely) be a top 10 favourite in your collection, but for the most part I found it to be an entertaining enough, easy read, though I won't be clamouring to read it again any time soon.
-=
The is the second Assassin's Creed book I've read, and while the writing in this one was somewhat better than Assassin's Creed: The Secret Crusade, I think the story somehow managed to be worse. There were ridiculous plot holes and plot devices, and Bowden has to rely on saying how long has passed to portray the passage of time. On numerous occasions I would think it was a matter of months since x, then someone would go "I haven't seen you for six years!" and I'd just be completely confused and trying to work out how on Earth this much time had passed.

One of my complaints with Secret Crusade was that the Assassin's didn't really seem to be any more skilful at fighting than their enemies which is luckily not a problem in this one, though probably in part thanks to the technological advantages Ezio has which Altair didn't. Still, this time the lead character wasn't infallible. Stuff went wrong and he failed sometimes which was good to see, and he did actually seem to be the better fighter most of the time. Having said this, he had a metal arm-guard hidden in his robes, and he seems to win a lot of fights when people become confused when they cut at his arm and it doesn't fall off.

The end of this book was weird, and confusing. I can honestly say I don't really understand what happened. This, however, may have been that I was more skim reading by this point because I was so desperate to reach the end.

Unfortunately, a couple of hundred pages in I accidentally made a link between Ezio and Esio Trot. Needless to say this book becomes a lot more amusing when you keeping getting random images of tortoises 'running' around Italian cities. Anyone who reads this book and gets bored: feel free to use this as a distraction tactic!
-=
Really just not good at all. I'm a huge fan of the Assassin's Creed video game series, but this book was a (poor) narration of one of the games, not a unique novel. Something is just completely lost when someone is trying to cover all the action that happens in a video game, but trying to act as if this is an actual historical novel. The video games do a fantastic job at this, but the author really didn't know what he was doing.
-=
I bought this book just because I love the game. I was surprised to see that the book was true to the game. The conversations is almost the same and the environment is described just as you saw it in the game. Bowden did a good job in filling out the blanks that wasn't included in the game and it was fun to read more indepth of Ezio's thoughts and life, especially in his younger days.
The thing I thought was strange with this book is that this actually is the second game, but it is the first book of the series. In the end, the book gets a little... Hasty? It seems as if the author didn't have enough time to finish writing the book properly. He doesn't skip events but he doesn't go into detail about them. It doesn't go along with the rest of the book in my opinion.
Otherwise I find this book really good just because it is based on the game and that it doesn't stray from the story. I like how he described the surroundings, the killings an the people and since I'm such a fan of the game I really appreciate how dedicated Bowden was to study and analyze the game just to write this book.
The book only get three stars from me since it kinda bothered me about the rushed ending and that is my favorite part of the story, otherwise the book was fantastic!
-=
If you loved Assassin's Creed II, this book is a great supplement to the story. It's an easy read geared toward teenagers, but enjoyable enough for adults who like the series. The story is filled with action and details all the power players of the story (which can be confusing in the game). It sticks pretty close to the story in the game, with only slight diversions. It is strictly about Ezio and his adventures and does not mention Desmond or the animus or Abstergo. 
-=
It's quite enjoyable. It actually reads like a video game, where the protagonist has to complete tasks and missions as a way to improve his weaponry and to get artifacts (in this case pages of a Codex) to unveil some greater power. It was nice to see how the Assassin could have played a role on various moments of Renaissance Italy. :P

I liked it so much I had to get my hands on the video games. I regret nothing!
-=
I have never played the game and wouldn't want to but I really enjoyed the book which is based on the game.
It is sent in the 1400's in Italy. I don't want to say too much as I don't want to type a spoiler, but I would recommend this book highly. 
-==
I've never played the game so I wasn't biased - I didn't care if it was better/worse than the game. Overall, it was an okay read. There were interesting characters - especially Leonardo da Vinci was fabulous! - but overall, they lacked depth. The book was fast-paced - to the point where the action just whooshed past you. The fights weren't described in detail, just skimmed over to get the reader from one point to another - after all, the book covered 27 years of plot and history. I would have preferred if the author left out some parts and focused on others in more detail. Also, for an experienced Assassin, Ezio sometimes made stupid, glaring mistakes! And the more experienced he was, the more mistakes he made, go figure! Nonetheless, it was fun. Until the end...!

The Vault and the Gods and their Message - I didn't get it. At all. It was like from a different book, a sci-fi element suddenly rammed into it. I would have preferred if the author kept that part out - or made it more believable. I just didn't get what Minerva wanted from Ezio. I got that she wanted the Assassins to find some Temples, but why or how or who built them... Ugh, the message was so obscure that it lacked any sense at all.
-=
Exactly it looks like -- that is, a trashy novel adaptation of the PS3/360/PC game, Assassin's Creed II. But a friend gave me it for free, and I'm such a fan of the games I couldn't pass up reading it.

The book, much like the game, follows Ezio's life from seventeen, but the end is slightly changed, so it finishes when he's forty-four rather than forty. The framing narrative of Desmond in the modern day going back and reliving his ancestor's memories is completely absent here; it's all Ezio's POV. It works... for the most part.

Much of the dialogue and events are lifted directly from the game, which is both a good and a bad thing. The author takes his own liberties and tries to change things to better fit the novel format, but sometimes it is awkward, incorrect or outright out of character. He insists Mario Auditore's villa is actually a castle (?), or that Ezio's eyes are 'cold blue-grey', when they're very clearly brown in the game. Maybe brown wasn't badass cold, calculating assassin enough for him, I don't know. But Ezio isn't a cold, calculating assassin, most of the time. He's angry, he almost enjoys killing, he shows off, makes it look messy and flashy. The author would have been better at writing cold, clinical Altaïr, because when he wasn't lifting game dialogue directly, Ezio lost a lot of his charm, for me.

There were other little things that bothered me, too, like Ezio basically dumping his mother and sister at a convent after they fled Florence. What the hell? His father and brothers were just killed by a close family friend and Ezio would just go and leave them? And Ezio's apparent obsession with Cristina, when he all but seems to forget about her in game. After twenty or so years, you... would have thought he'd gotten over her, especially with Rosa and such, but nope, the author seemed intent on forcing twu wuv on the manwhore assassin. Riiight.

Gratuitous Italian is used, just like in the game, except this time there aren't any subtitles, so you have to flip to the back of the book to find the glossary. Ruined the flow a lot, for me. The author also seemed to hate the word 'said' with a passion, used a thesaurus just as gratuitously as an Italian dictionary, and loved huge run-on sentences, like such: From the roof of the citadel, he could see that the courtyard was deserted, leapt down to the top of its colonnade, and dropped down to the ground. Which had me going 'bzuh?!' every time. It could have easily been two sentences!

I could go on and on about all the faults, but we'd be here all day, and it wasn't like I was expecting much anyway. It was decent, and there were one or two added scenes that were nice, like Ezio giving his family a proper funeral. But the 'sorry Ezio, you're just a plot device to move the series forward' ending the game had was here unsatisfying and nonsensical without Desmond. At least we're left feeling as bewildered as Ezio, I guess?

Never played the game but would realy like to so I thought I would realy enjoyed this and with lots of action and a great feel for 15century Italy. I was hoping for an excellent ending, however was very disappointed and had to re-read the last few pages again to see if i missed anything.

I played the game and I enjoyed the story a lot so I decided to get the book hoping it would have more juice to the story. It didn't. It's mostly equal to the game with some minor changes and one or two details that don't really add much.

Since my native language is portuguese the words in italian didn't break the flow for me and were a really nice addition, I liked it the same way I liked it in the game (I played through the game all in italian because it added to the experience).

The game is a much better way to experience the story but finishing the game could take you more than 15 hours. If you played the game there isn't much point in reading the book in my opinion unless you are really a fan.

This book, while an entertaining enough read, has the shallowest of storylines that follows a fairly linear plot. Character development is almost non-existent and it's basically just the script for another episode of the video game.

The hero moves from quest to quest, fighting ever-tougher opponents and gaining clues and better weapons as he goes until he faces the arch-bed guy at the end.

No surprises here at all!

This was ok..as in it wasn't bad, but it was deffinately geared more to a male reader. Need a little more emotion behind it. Does it follow along the lines of the games? No idea, as I've never played them. But all in all it's a book that's going to remain in my book shelf, so it's not to bad.
-=
A novel version of the game, but all from the Renaissance point of view, leaving out the modern day Desmond and crew. It sheds light on a few areas that aren't touched on in the game because of how the storyline is set up (IE: things dealing with his mother and sister, and what happened to the girl Cristina from the beginning of the game).
-=
While one should never expect too much from a media tie-in - in this case, a book based on the video game - this one delivers such promise. But not the product.
The book is - no more, no less - a novelization of the game. There's no extra prologue. No additional extrapolation. And that is where the book's promise was, in filling out characters, expanding on story aspects. These were never delivered. Each chapter read like a level of the game.
It was well novelized, however, with 'authentic' Italian phrases peppered throughout.
Unless you enjoyed the game, this novel has little to offer you. Fans of historical fiction will find even less enjoyment.

Okay, this book wasn't TOO bad. Like others have said, it's great for someone that wants to know about the story line of AC, but doesn't want to take the time to play the game. I'm not sure how many people fit that bill, though. There aren't that many things that are included in the book that aren't included in the game. The writing is adequate, I guess. I give it 4 stars because I love the story line, even though the writing is pretty bland at times. Sometimes I thought the use of Italian words was a bit distracting and didn't make me feel like it made the book more "legitimate". I love the city of Venice, so that helps too, but Bowden doesn't go into a lot of detail about the city itself, which I wish he did. If you want to relive the game, but don't want to be bothered to play it, read this. I would always recommend playing the game over reading the book.
-=
It had it's moments of being decent when the author was actually acting like he had any imagination, but for most of the book, he kept breaking one of the most sacred rules of story writing: show me, don't tell me. There were times in the book that I could accept this rule to be bent and maybe even broken, but no where near as often as he did it. He very rarely had any full scenes in the entire book because he just keep brushing it under "this happened, and this happened, and now we're here." I've never read or even heard of anything by Oliver Bowden before, so I can't honestly say if this writing style, or lack there of, is typical of him, or if it was the result of writing under the restriction of a commercial novel. but even with that said, after reading the book, the editor was just as much to blame as the author for some of the slop that was allowed to get past.

"Assassins Creed: Renaissance" by Oliver Bowden is a fantastic book for fans of the video game series. Assassins Creed: Renaissance is a book based on a video game named "Assassins Creed 2" which is about a person named Ezio Auditore who lives a perfectly normal life until his family is betrayed and his father & brothers are executed for something they did not do. Once the executions take place Ezio learns that his family from generation to generation has been a family working as assassins. Once Ezio learns about this he sets out on a wild and adventurous journey to avenge his family but along the way he learns more than he could possibly imagine.

Overall I give this book 5 Stars and would recommend it to anybody looking for an adventurous book, or any fan of the series who would like to expand their knowledge of it. Or just any casual reader.
-=
A good book but it drags on a lot. The Latin/italian phrases used throughout also break the flow of the book as you're constantly flipping to the back to figure out what they mean. The ending is the best part of the book but a little too abrupt. Also a little too vulgar for my taste in places. Be prepared to squirm when women are threatening to shove mens heads up her figa. There are only a few places like this though

I am not much of a gamer, but when I saw my friend playing this game one night,I loved the storyline so much, I really wanted to play it. The next day I was walking by some books, and saw an actual book based off of the game. I was so thrilled, not only was I going to get a more in depth storyline than some game, but it was going to be about $100 cheaper considering I would have had to buy an Xbox just to play the game. This book is very great, and my heart was attatched to the main character almost immediately in the storyline. The suspense will keep you going, and you will not want to put the book down. That is, if you like a story such as this.
-=
This book was amazing. It was a lot different from the game. More details and better dialogue. Ezio has finally avenged his family's death. He has become a member of the Assassin's Creed. He has found all these Codex pages, pages to blueprints of weapons and a map to the vault. He has collected the "two pieces of Eden" and offered them to the vault. It was kind of confusing. The Templars(evil dudes) were talking about God and only one vault but Ezio saw the greek goddess. The templars were either dumb or they didn't know anything about the Vault. Overall this was a great book.
-=
The book was good and was unpredictable and was a little extreme for a revenge story but has good twists and turns with surprises everywhere. The book takes place in 1500 renaissance with the main character wanting revenge on his family that was killed unjustly by the florence government. the book is good and has good plot and character development through out the story. i recommend it if action and suspense with a little bit of romance is your genre.
-=
This book was sort of a gimme for me, as I deeply enjoy the game series and, having played them, had a pretty fair idea of what the novel would be about and where the plot would be heading, etc.
Oliver Bowden gives us a fairly straight-forward account of the video game, owing for a more realistic viewpoint of time and training that is simply glossed over in the game due to the fact that your average gamer geek simply doesn't care how much time has passed (unless it's relevant to the actual game-play in some fashion).
There's not much I can say about Mr. Bowden's style given the source material. It presented the story adequately without boring me to any significant degree. But honestly, that's about it. There wasn't much of a "punch" to the story-telling and Mr. Bowden just couldn't quite give his telling the sense of power or excitement I had hoped for; that driving need that would have gripped me and held me to my seat, my eyes glued to the pages.
In all a decent rendition of a game story with a few additions that the typical gamer probably didn't bother to look into. I give it two stars. Now, if the author had been able to skillfully weave the story of Modern-day Desmond's life into the telling...
Ah, well, perhaps the next one... 
-=
I have always LOVED, LOVE, and will ALWAYS LOVE the game!!!

Omg... although the characters were CGI, they're freakin' hot especially with those deadly accent!! =P~ drooool...

and now this book captures absolutely every single detail from the game! And the best part? I can always look back into their conversation!!

I love this book so far!!

It reminds me so much of the game, has hilarious moments too! :D
-=
I was genuinely surprised by how much I liked this book. I bought it mostly because I am somewhat obsessed with the game, and I wanted more Ezio, now please! I expected that at best it would be bearable to read because I don't tend to think too highly of novelizations of either movies or video games. But this was really good and fun.

Most of the story in the book is in the game as well, so the plot wasn't particularly surprising. But there were a few additional details - like, say, Leonardo's homosexuality, which wasn't even alluded to in the game (or if it was, I missed it) - that were fun to read about. Overall it's solidly written, and I have to say that considering the amount of both climbing and fight scenes he had to cover, the author did a really good job with this, and apparently had fun with it too (the Machiavelli jokes are a bit silly, but *I* loved them!).

I can imagine parts of the story are a bit harder to follow for people who haven't played the game, and I wish the book had covered the parts involving the present tense as well, but as it is I really enjoyed it. Especially because Ezio spends a ridiculous amount of time thinking about Leonardo ;)
-=
I bought this thinking it would be another story of Ezio rather than just what basically turned out to be a retelling of the game with quite a few errors in its telling, particularly in the ending. Whilst the game left itself open to the events of Brotherhood the book doesn't.

Whilst it's not terribly written I've read many better and it probably only gets the score it does because of the fact that I love Assassin's Creed in general.
-=
I thought this book was interesting and full of intrigue. At first this book begins with a young man seeking revenge for his family. Along the way there are many twists and turns and as his path takes a different direction to which he first set out on. A fantastic read despite being based upon a computer game.
-=
I had to force myself not to rate this novel a little higher than I have done. The reason for this is, simply put, I'm hooked on the story of this series, and, for that reason, I couldn't put this book down. If you don't know that this book is part of a wider series that includes a number of video games, then you are the reason I adjusted my rating.

I got invested in this story from the video games, and came to the books later, and, unfortunately, this novel suffers a little from the adaptation, much like stories offer suffer when being adapted from novel to big screen production.

So, firstly, the bit I like, the overall story, is interesting, has the feel of authenticity (though I am no expert on fifteenth century Italy) and has a nice mix of emotional highs and action. The main character is a fleshed out, complicated person who the reader can invest their time in, and really get behind.

Where the book suffers, is trying to adhere to the story of the video game a little too closely. At times, the plot has a definite "moving from A to B" feel to it, where the game has necessarily skipped a chunk of story for pacing's sake, but the novel would have benefited from a little more detail. It is not a short book, by any means, and this may have contributed to the "slash-cut" feel of some of the transitions. There are [presently] four novels in this series, but I couldn't help but feel that this story could have benefited from a little more detail and, perhaps, being split into two (or even three) individual novels. Unfortunately, I suspect that would never have been possible, with this being a tie-in novel.

Another area this story suffers is the unshakable feeling that it has been rushed. From the occasional typo (which, let's be honest, somehow find their way into a lot of novels, no matter how edited), to writing faux pas, such as continually repeating the same point over and over, or switching view points at will. The writer has a nice style and seems to know his stuff, but I can't help but feel that the manuscript should have received a little more attention from the editors before going to print.

To sum up; if you, like me, played the games and got heavily invested in the story, I recommend this novel. If you are the kind of person who can look past less than exemplary prose for an interesting story, I recommend this novel. For everyone else, probably best to read a sample before pulling out that hard earned cash for this one.
